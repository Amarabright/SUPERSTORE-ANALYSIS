# Recommendation

There are no doubts that the Business is performing well as the major product it is known for, is been sold (Bikes), However, there is room for more improvements.


 - The accessories and clothing subcategories are not doing much in sales. Strategies to increase the sales should be made like "discounted bundle-selling" where for any purchase of bike, accessories and clothing will be added as an offer in addition to the bikes but at a  discounted price which will be cheaper compared to when they are buying the accessories or clothing as a stand-alone product.

 - Use database to gather customer feedback to get their experiences about the product or services. This information can be used to identify areas for improvement.

 - Partner with local organization to promote bike riding in the community. This would help increase awareness of bike products and generate positive word of mouth marketing.

 - Understand Customers purchasing pattern by carrying out an analysis on this. This will tell what customers are buying, when they are buying  and how to promote the goods to the customers.
